Summary: Elevated intraocular pressure is a major rick factor for glaucoma.  IOP heritability has been estimated to up to 67%.  And to date only 11 IOP loci have been reported, accounting for 1.5% of IOP variability.  The paper conducts a genome-wide-association study for IOP in untreated individuals with different ancestry.  They identify 47 genome-wide significant IOP-associated loci.  The paper concludes by examining the effect of the loci on the risk of glaucoma.  

### Dataset 
- GERA: Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging.  Included 356, 987 IOP measurements from 69,756 people

### Definitions 
- **Locus**: The position of a gene or mutation in a chromosome
- **GWAS**: Genome wide analysis
- **Genomic Inflation factor**: Ratio of the median of the empirically observed distribution of the test statistic to the expected median
- **SNP**: Each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide
- **Type I Error**: False Positive (Null: True && Reject)
- **Type II Error**: False Negative (Null: False && Accept)
- **Bonferonni Correction**: Compensates for the increased chance of incorrectly rejecting a null hypothesis when multiples hypothesis are tested. 

### Notes
- Elevated IOP is the main modifiable risk factor in glaucoma development and progression
- Twin and family studies indicate that IOP has a moderate genetic component with heritability estimates ranging from .29 to .67 
- Genetic association studies have reported 11 loci associated with IOP, which account for up to 1.5% of the variance of this ocular trait.  The limited variance explained suggests that additional loci remain to be discovered
- IOP can vary as a result of different factors, including time of day, corneal thickness, medications, measurement technique, and demographic factors.  
- Incorporating information from multiple longitudinal measurements collected through electronic health records has been shown to improve the precision of the characterization of phenotypes
- There were about 70,000 untreated GERA subjects with a total of about 357,000 IOP measurements taken.  The analysis used the mean IOP of both eyes and selected the median of the mean of the IOP of both eyes
- The authors investigated whether the the 47 lead IOP-associated SNPs were also associated with primary OAG by performing a case-control analysis 
- The authors found associations with Glaucoma at a Bonferroni level of significance (P < .00106 = .05 / 47) for 6 SNPs 
- Evaluated the associations of the 47 lead IOP-associated SNPâ€™s with glaucoma susceptibility with logistic regression under an additive model, with adjustments for age, sex, and ancestry PCs
