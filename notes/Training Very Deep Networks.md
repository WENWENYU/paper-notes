## Training Very Deep Networks

##### **R. Srivastava, K. Greff, J. Schmidhuber (2015)**

Summary: The paper starts by making the claim that the depth of NN’s is necessary for their success.  The problem is that as 
network depth increases training becomes difficult.  The paper introduces the concept of highway networks to overcome this 
issue.  These networks are inspired by LSTM RNN’s.  The authors state that the primary contribution is to show that extremely 
deep highway networks can be trained using SGD.
